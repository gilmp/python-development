<!-- 
  GOOD START!! TRY USING THE FORMATTING A BIT MORE! THIS ISNT A PLAIN TEXT FILE!

  Readme's should be clear, descriptive and tell a user who has never seen
  your project before what and how it is used. It can be VERY important.
  It is not a plain text file when viewed in github/gitlab, the format is Markdown.
  You can do some simple formatting, links, images, etc. 

  Formatting pointers:
    # is heading1, ## is 2, ### is 3, etc
    Carriage returns arent rendered unless you do a double space at the end of the line
    bullet point lists are done with - (like ansible)
    URLs are done using [](), eg [My Super Link](http://my_super_link.com)

  Things to do:
    Write what the project is for, eg. "This project is a demonstration of python"
    If people have to do anything special with the repo to make it work, tell them in the readme
      eg, in our WSO2 projects, to deploy the code you run "./gradlew deployApiAndCar"
      if you'd never seen a wso2 project before, you would never guess that...
    
  Things to avoid:
    dont duplicate information thats already in the code 
    ie, drawing out the directory structure is a maintenance nightmate, and helps noone
    dont write war and peace, just enough that people know whats going on

<!-- suggestion: I dont think showing a link of the page you are on is useful... BUT why not add a section called # Resources 
                 and put all the links you have been using to teach yourself python. That way if someone sees your repo they
                 might go and check out some of the resources you used to teach themselves -->

<!-- suggestion: Bug bear of mine... whats the point in writing out the directory structure which changes all the time.
                 It's maintenance for you (it will be out of date in a few commits) and you can see the structure by actually
                 looking at the repo... it doesnt add anything. HOWEVER, maybe there are particular scripts of interest. It
                 would be sensible to highlight those if you felt there was anything that stood out -->
