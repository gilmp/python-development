# x and y has a defined list containing 1,2,3. There is a method that uses print is x is equal to y then print out true

x = [1,2,3]
y = [1,2,3]
print(x == y) # Prints out True
print(x is y) # Prints out False

# Unsure how the not works ##

print(not False) # Prints out True
print((not False) == (False)) # Prints out False
